Tested on:        HP 9000/780/C160 running HP-UX 11.00
C compiler used:  Version A.11.01.02
Purpose:
A new version of diff adapted for source code. The well known program diff is
inappropriate for some common tasks such as comparing the output of floating
oint calculations where roundoff errors lead diff astray and comparing program
source code where some differences in the text (such as white space and
comments) have no effect on the operation of the compiled code. Spiff addresses
these cases.
